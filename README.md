# xv6-rng70
This is modified version of official xv6-public version. As it was stated that "The main purpose of xv6 is as a teaching operating system for MIT's 6.S081, so we are more interested in simplifications and clarifications than new features" so no PR will be made through this fork.

# Installation 
This version is slightly modified and tested on

*   OS: Garuda Linux
*   Kernel: 5.15.12-zen1-1-zen
*   GCC/G++: 11.1.0

***Case 1: make qemu "error: writing 1 byte into a region of size 0"***

​	two lines added before and after ***line 1461: *lastaddr = 99; in usertests.c***

```c
#pragma GCC diagnostic ignored "-Wstringop-overflow"
*lastaddr = 99;
#pragma GCC diagnostic pop
```

***Case 2: qemu hangs on "Booting from hard disk..."***

​	this problem occurs specially on arch linux though it is quite common for other distros also. See PR[#155](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public/pull/155). to solve this problem Makefile was slightly modified.

## official statement
NOTE: we have stopped maintaining the x86 version of xv6, and switched
our efforts to the RISC-V version
(https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv.git)

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern x86-based multiprocessor using ANSI C.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

xv6 is inspired by John Lions's Commentary on UNIX 6th Edition (Peer
to Peer Communications; ISBN: 1-57398-013-7; 1st edition (June 14,
2000)). See also https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/, which
provides pointers to on-line resources for v6.

xv6 borrows code from the following sources:
    JOS (asm.h, elf.h, mmu.h, bootasm.S, ide.c, console.c, and others)
    Plan 9 (entryother.S, mp.h, mp.c, lapic.c)
    FreeBSD (ioapic.c)
    NetBSD (console.c)

The following people have made contributions: Russ Cox (context switching,
locking), Cliff Frey (MP), Xiao Yu (MP), Nickolai Zeldovich, and Austin
Clements.

ERROR REPORTS

We don't process error reports (see note on top of this file).

BUILDING AND RUNNING XV6

To build xv6 on an x86 ELF machine (like Linux or FreeBSD), run
"make". On non-x86 or non-ELF machines (like OS X, even on x86), you
will need to install a cross-compiler gcc suite capable of producing
x86 ELF binaries (see https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/).
Then run "make TOOLPREFIX=i386-jos-elf-". Now install the QEMU PC
simulator and run "make qemu".
